# AI Video Studio

An AI-powered video generation platform that creates emotive or informative vertical videos from scripts using multiple AI services.

## Overview

AI Video Studio combines TTS (Pipecat), background video generation (Sora 2), music generation (Gemini with Lyra), and FFmpeg video composition to create professional vertical videos (1080x1920) optimized for mobile viewing.

## Recent Changes

- 2025-12-31: Production Readiness Fixes
  - Removed Edge TTS completely (no longer used)
  - TTS fallback chain: IndexTTS-2 → k2-fsa → silent audio
  - Fixed session table auto-creation for production (createTableIfMissing: true)
  - Added automatic cleanup for stale intermediate files (preserves final videos)
  - Fixed video URL handling to prevent overwriting after Drive upload
  - Downloaded proper voice reference files from IndexTTS-2 repo

- 2025-12-04: Timed Synchronized Subtitles
  - Created subtitleUtils.ts for generating ASS format timed subtitles
  - Subtitles split into segments based on sentence/clause breaks (periods, commas, etc.)
  - Word-count-based timing distributes duration proportionally across segments
  - Normalization ensures total segment time fits within audio duration (no overflow)
  - Mobile-optimized styling: yellow text, bottom-center, proper word wrapping
  - FFmpeg integration via ass filter replaces static text overlay
  - Graceful fallback to static subtitles if script is empty
  - Subtitle files cleaned up after video composition

- 2025-11-19: Duration Policy System (Sora Constraint Handling)
  - Implemented smart duration policy to handle Sora API's fixed 10s/15s duration constraint
  - Created duration snapping logic: audio ≤10s → 10s video, audio >10s → 15s video
  - Added audio padding with silence to match target Sora duration (never truncates speech)
  - Implemented video freeze-frame extension to match padded audio length
  - Fixed critical bug where 10.1-10.5s audio would cause speech truncation
  - New utility modules: durationPolicy.ts, audioUtils.ts, videoUtils.ts
  - Videos now perfectly sync with narration length while respecting Sora constraints
  - Warns users if script approaches or exceeds 15s limit

- 2025-11-19: TTS Integration with IndexTTS-2
  - Integrated IndexTTS-2 Hugging Face Space API for text-to-speech generation
  - Created server-side TTS service using @gradio/client with voice cloning support
  - Added default voice/emotion reference audio files (WAV format)
  - Implemented graceful fallback to silent audio if TTS API fails
  - Fixed format consistency: all narration audio now uses WAV (pcm_s16le) format
  - Added comprehensive validation and error handling for TTS responses
  - Fixed missing ApiKeyManager import in home.tsx

- 2025-11-02: User Project Management (Task 2 Complete)
  - Built ProjectList component with toggle-elevate selection and complete data-testid coverage
  - Implemented project loading: loads title, script, videoType into editor; shows preview for complete projects
  - Added confirmation dialog (AlertDialog) for project deletion with proper state cleanup
  - Integrated responsive 1/2/2 layout (sidebar/editor/preview) with toggle visibility
  - Project creation and deletion auto-refresh sidebar via React Query cache invalidation
  - Fixed isProcessing state management: editor unlocks when loading non-processing projects
  - "New Project" button clears editor; "My Projects" button toggles sidebar
  - Empty state and loading skeleton for project list

- 2025-11-02: User Authentication System (Task 1 Complete)
  - Implemented Replit Auth with OpenID Connect for multi-provider login
  - Added users and sessions tables with proper foreign key relationships
  - Protected all project routes with authentication middleware and ownership verification
  - Built landing page for unauthenticated users with login flow
  - Updated Home page with user profile, avatar, and logout button
  - Fixed session expiry handling with proper 401 detection and auto-redirect
  - useAuth hook uses getQueryFn({ on401: "returnNull" }) for reliable state management
  - Session cookies configured with secure flag for production only
  - Auth state transition tracking with toast notifications on session expiry

## Video Processing Pipeline

1. **Analyzing** (10%) - Extract themes and emotional beats
2. **TTS Generation** (30%) - Create voiceover (Pipecat placeholder)
3. **Music Generation** (50%) - Compose background music (Gemini placeholder)
4. **Video Generation** (70%) - Generate background video (Sora placeholder)
5. **Composition** (90%) - FFmpeg merges all assets with subtitles
6. **Complete** (100%) - Video ready for preview/download

## Next Steps

1. User to provide API keys for Sora 2, Gemini, and Pipecat
2. Replace placeholder AI service calls with real API integrations
3. Fine-tune video generation parameters
4. Consider deploying/publishing the application
